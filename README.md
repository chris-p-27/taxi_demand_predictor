# Taxi Demand Predictor

Welcome to the **Taxi Demand Predictor** project! ðŸš–

This project aims to build a predictive model for forecasting taxi demand in New York City. By leveraging historical data and machine learning, this application will help users find the best time and location to catch a cab, optimizing both convenience and availability.

## Project Overview

Predicting taxi demand is essential for urban transportation planning and improving passenger experience. In this project, we will:

1. **Analyze** historical taxi demand data in New York City.
2. **Build** a machine learning model to forecast demand based on time, location, weather, and other factors.
3. **Deploy** an interactive app to visualize demand predictions and suggest the best locations for catching a cab in real-time.

## Objectives

- Provide real-time insights into high-demand locations and times.
- Help passengers find taxis faster, reducing wait times.
- Lay the groundwork for more advanced predictive models in urban transportation.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Data files and datasets for model training and testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- **src/**: Source code for the machine learning model and app.
- **README.md**: Overview and project details.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Run initial data exploration notebooks to understand the dataset.
4. Train the model and test its predictions.
5. Deploy the app and start exploring NYC taxi demand!

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time traffic and weather data for more accurate predictions.
- Enhance the model to support multiple cities.
